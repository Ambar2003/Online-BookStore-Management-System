A user-friendly Online Bookstore project in which users can log in or register, view the available books, 
select books along with their quantity, and buy them. We also have implemented Admin functionality. The admin can add new
books, remove existing books, increase or decrease the quantity etc...

It is available as a zip file in this repository because there's a 100 files limit and our project has more than 100 files.
